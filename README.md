# GGJ19

## Global Game Jam 2019 with Team Chonky Games

### Jam Theme - What home means to you

Play as a round woman trying to get home during the end of the world. On your way you must collect as many of your pet round animals as possible while the road behind you crumbles and falls down into hell. Collect power ups to make your journey easier (and to attract animals in with the food), and try not to destroy any obstacles in your way! Aim to get through the door of your house with as many points as possible!
